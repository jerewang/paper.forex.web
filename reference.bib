abstract = "This paper addresses whether macro news arrivals affect currency markets over time. The null from macro exchange rate theory is that they do not: macro news is impounded in exchange rates instantaneously. We test this by examining the effects of news on subsequent trades by end-user participants (such as hedge funds, mutual funds, and non-financial corporations). News arrivals induce subsequent changes in trading in all of the major end-user segments. These induced changes remain significant for days. Induced trades also have persistent effects on prices. Currency markets are not responding to news instantaneously."

abstract = "We study the impact of nine categories of scheduled and unscheduled news announcements on the euro/dollar return volatility. We highlight and analyze the pre-announcement, contemporaneous and post-announcement reactions. Using high-frequency intraday data and within the framework of ARCH-type models, we show that volatility increases in the pre-announcement periods, particularly before scheduled events. Market activity also significantly impacts return volatility as expected by the theoretical literature on the order flow."

keywords = "Currency jumps, Cojumps, Macroeconomic news",
abstract = "This study investigates the impact of macro news on currency jumps and cojumps. The analysis uses intra-day data, sampled at 5-min frequency, for four currencies for the period 2005–2010. Results indicate that currency jumps are a good proxy for news arrival. We find 9–15% of currency jumps can be directly linked to U.S. announcements. Notably, news can explain 22–56% of the 5-min jump returns, and there is evidence that better-than-expected news about the U.S. economy has a negative impact on currency jumps. Cojump statistics suggest close dependencies among European currencies, especially between the euro and the Swiss franc. We also provide evidence on the uncertainty resolution to news."

author = "Martin D.D. Evans and Richard K. Lyons",
keywords = "Information, Microstructure, Announcements, Heterogeneity",
abstract = "Macro news can affect currency prices directly and indirectly via order flow. Past research shows that the direct effects of scheduled macro news account for less than 10% of daily price variance. This paper shows that the arrival of macro news can account for more than 30% of daily price variance. Two features of our analysis account for this finding: (1) We consider the broad spectrum of macro news items that market participants observe, not just scheduled announcements. (2) We allow the arrival of news to affect prices indirectly via its impact on the volatility of order flow. Our analysis shows that order flow variations contribute more to currency price dynamics following the arrival of public macro news than at other times. This is not consistent with news effects being common knowledge that is impounded in price directly. Roughly two-thirds of the total effect of macro news on the DM/$ exchange rate is transmitted via order flow."

abstract = "This paper reports empirical evidence that a neural network model is applicable to the prediction of foreign exchange rates. Time series data and technical indicators, such as moving average, are fed to neural networks to capture the underlying “rules” of the movement in currency exchange rates. The exchange rates between American Dollar and five other major currencies, Japanese Yen, Deutsch Mark, British Pound, Swiss Franc and Australian Dollar are forecast by the trained neural networks. The traditional rescaled range analysis is used to test the “efficiency” of each market before using historical data to train the neural networks. The results presented here show that without the use of extensive market data or knowledge, useful prediction can be made and significant paper profits can be achieved for out-of-sample data with simple technical indicators. A further research on exchange rates between Swiss Franc and American Dollar is also conducted. However, the experiments show that with efficient market it is not easy to make profits using technical indicators or time series input neural networks. This article also discusses several issues on the frequency of sampling, choice of network architecture, forecasting periods, and measures for evaluating the model's predictive power. After presenting the experimental results, a discussion on future research concludes the paper."

We investigate payoff guarantees that are expressed in terms of the extremity of the upcrossings. We obtain an exact and elegant characterisation of the guarantees that can be achieved. Moreover, we derive a simple canonical strategy for each attainable guarantee."
